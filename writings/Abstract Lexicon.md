## Outline
### Purpose
I guess what I’m trying to build is not necessarily a system that will be used by a group, but by a single individual, and the system is meant to help the user learn more about themselves.

There are a few core components of this system

Sensors: all the most relevant data about yourself is captured. In existing solutions, this is done using manual logging, and I would like to automate some of this. Dashboard: the captured data is displayed to the user is a user-friendly way that enables them to notice patterns about themselves. Layers: the dashboard creates a summary of the captured data, but the user always has the possibility to unpack the complexity behind a single pattern. Through this process, the user should be able to inform the system on what aspects of themselves they want to focus on, what kind of patterns they want to keep an eye out for. Expectations and reality management: the user’s define self-goal is used to point out where the user might be going off track based on their initial goal. This might mean that the user needs to modify their goal or behavior to attain a higher level of coherence.

### MAIN PROGRAM: Scriptural Analysis
1. Identify linguistic patterns in the Quran  
   a. NLP techniques  
   b. Mathematical modeling of narratives  
   c. Use academic books and papers analyzing the language of the Quran as references  
2. Add new patterns to a database  
   a. Check for duplicate or near-duplicates  
   b. Enable users to compare their personal databases  
   c. [Laws of Metaphor](https://ericsteinhart.com/ANALOGY/lom-home.html)  
   d. Logic Proof Theory as a 3D Puzzle Game  
3. Provide intuitive tools for searching and updating the database  
   a. Pattern visualization  
      - 3D Mind maps, network graphs  

### SECONDARY PROGRAM: Self Analysis
1. Record user daily log  
   a. Flexible data format  
   b. Identify key data points  
      - Emotions  
      - Visited locations  
      - Timestamps  
   c. Conversion to structured format to add to database  
2. Match patterns between user log and Quran

### The innevitability of sharing knowledge: avoiding groupthink in collective research
We know there are benefits to collaboration. Some have capabilities or shortcomings that others don't. Each person can fill some of the gaps in the research of the other. Simply by "keeping your bullshit meter very high", we can avoid groupthink. By leaving lots of room for doubt.

There is a community of practice without hierarchical structures, and no collective identity, no collective strategy or action. Individual action. We only collaborate in sharing personal results, insights and efforts, as far as religion goes.

You should have non-religious organizations, political, economic, medical, etc. Human watch organization.

## Methodology
1. Questions  
2. Gather all observations (root-word analysis, form analysis) (it’s an art and not an exact science)  
3. Divine guidance, patience, dua, may take you on a detour to learn the pre-requisites. The answer to the dua is always positive given we understand.  
4. Dhikrah. Never trust it.  
5. Validation: go through all observations and see if the dhikrah fits with them. Plausibility of dhikrah.  
6. Verification:  
   a. **Active:** More observations, beyond root-word analysis, examples that support our interpretation. Other janaah. Markings.  
   b. **Passive:** Disproving the dhikrah. What criteria will disprove your dhikrah? Address the potential refutations or arguments against the dhikrah. Passive verification never ends. We never have 100% certainty. This teaches plasticity.
