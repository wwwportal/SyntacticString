By matching the physical behavior of stallelite-tracked humans through their linguistically-centered social media presence, linguistic representations of socio-physical patterns can be used to catalogue successful socio-linguistic behavioral patterns along with their triggers.

What is my mission? What is my vision for my career and how does my mission towards Allah compare or contrast with it? I no longer really see my career as a means of changing the world. I have already presented a new model for global transformation. One that does not require much physical effort. But it does require lots of intellectual energy. What is it I want to build as a programmer? Will I be given the opportunity to build such a thing? Ultimately I want to create experiences that will enable people to get a better understanding of their role in this world, and basically present the new model of global transformation. In other words, my mission is tightly related to my mission towards Allah. Coding projects are particularly appealing because they never remain the same. They get updates, and usually the updates make the program better rather than worse. What is it I want to build? It’s a quran app, but it’s more than that. An app the gamifies the process of interpreting the scripture. Let’s recall, what’s the purpose of interpreting the scripture? To communicate with the real God. What or who is that? What does it mean to communicate with God?

What I call ‘the gamification’ of Quranic interpretation, I essentially mean a software that willl facilitate data entry into a database and searching therefrom.

Additional feature: the peer-review system: I know that a peer-review system can quickly become one-sided once an authority has been put in place, one that is difficult to question. I wish to solve this issue by labeling contributions according to Quranic principles. Say someone proposes an interpretation or supplication. Someone else would review it. They are not allowed to say just anything, but are supposed to support or refute the contribution based on Quranic principles. You can think of these principles as moves, just like you’d have in a video game. The player can attack or defend the contribution using a limited number of moves. How does the global brain fit into this project? That’s basically where the multiplayer side of things come into play. So I need to spend more time thinking about how the multiplayer system will work.
