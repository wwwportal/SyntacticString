# Semantic Scaling: Linguistic Substitution to show relationships rather than 2d mindmap
The idea is that mindmaps can show more information at once than can be represented in prose. However, what if we had a system for zooming in and out of a text that did not result in changing the size of displayed text but rather to show the structure within which it is nested (zoom out) and the elements nested within it (zoom in).
