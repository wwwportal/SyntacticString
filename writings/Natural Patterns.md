I am obsessed with patterns. As time goes on, I find myself more interested in abstract patterns that are grounded in evidence-based data. However, I find myself distressed by the number of different fields. I don't know what kind of data I should analyze, and I don't want to get stuck in a single subfield. What if there could be a way to analyze any sort of data. A sort of meta-analysis method. Maybe neural networks. Something universal will probably remain out of reach for a few thousands of years, so I still need to narrow down my interests. I have already decided that communication networks are one of my core interests, but this is still too broad a category.

Nature is filled with patterns. Recently I began a systematic identification of the patterns I found appealing, and went down a bit of a dizzying rabbit hole. I noticed a pattern in my growing collection of patterns, but as soon as I expanded my collection to include other patterns in nature, I became overwhelmed by the level of complexity in nature.

I started out with roots, veins, fractals, moss, mold, slime mold, bone marrow, fascia, spider webs (and other kinds of webs), thorny vines, electrical discharges, intestines, succuluent cacti, certain types of microorganisms, computer circuits and wiring and the sort. These all have morphological similarities. I went in to add forms with thicker bodies like mushrooms, sea creatures, insects, corals, crystals, and other more complex systems.

At this point, I got a glimpse of the scale of what I was trying to do. It would be impossible for me to find general patterns that exhaust the morphological lexicon of nature. If we take all scales in consideration, the combinations are practically endless. I haven't lost hope, but I know this calls for a change of direction in my research.

First, I needed to understand the purpose of my research. What am I trying to accomplish? Most of the time, my research is driven by a deep intuition that I can very only verbalize precisely with great difficulty, so I will keep it vague. It goes something like the following. Each thing does not necessarily logically follow from the next. This is more of a tapestry of ideas.

What rules lead to the formation of these patterns? They can all be found in nature. They represent the solidification of a pattern of communication between interlocuting organisms. Path-finding behaviors depend on  the density of the individual and its environment/medium. The density of the medium depends on the relationships between its constituent parts. This seems to be true for all scales.

Form is equivalent to function.
Function implicates purpose.
Purpose is teleonomic.
The function of a thing is the reaction to a state of affairs.
The state of affairs has a form.
The state of affairs has a function.
The function of a thing can be defined from a number of perspectives.
One perspective can define a number of functions to a thing.
Perspective is composed of a number of things.
A set of things is a thing.
A perspective has a form.
A perspective has a function.
The function of a perspective can only be determined from a different perspective.
The function of a thing can only be defined from another thing.
There exists a thing that can define itself.
The self is a state of affairs.
The function of this thing is to refine its self-definition. Call it the autopoetic.
Autopoetic has an environment that it must interact with.
The environment is a set of things.
Autopoetic defines itself through interacting with its environment.
Its environment becomes part of its self-identification.
There are other autopoetics in the environment.
Autopoetics begin to define themselves based on each other that they can perceive.
Perception is limited by form.
Form is function.
Function is holonic (exhibiting the properties of a holon).
For all functions to be interoperable, there must be a common medium.
A common medium implicates a common environment.
The environment is a thing.
The environment has a form.
The environment has a function.
The environment as a whole is one.
Form is function.
Function is non-physical.
Non-physical is mental.
All is mind.
All has function.
All has form.
A thing's form must be a part of the whole's form.
Things are not static.
Since function is teleonomic, then a thing must seek something.
A thing seeks something.
Something has a form.
Something has a function.
Things seek function.
By doing so, they change form.
